2010s was fiery youth, pure happiness, kaleidoscopic colors, dying in LA, mass transformations/adaptations, directions and the lack thereof, and learning we are not what we thought we were. What was done, what was said - maybe it was a whole lot of baggage, maybe there’s not much else to look forward to. But maybe if we find any way to a wild heart, one foot in front of another, and stay ‘til the A.M., god will save our youngblood. Because, after all, being on top of the world, acting stupid for fun, living wild and free, that’s the way it’s supposed to be, no?

Next decade, do the next right thing.

也許世界就這樣
我也還在路上
新的十年，迎接星辰日出，再见孤独
